## Installation

### Step 1: Install reactivesearch via NPM

We will fetch the [`reactivesearch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appbaseio/reactivesearch) module first from npm.

```js
npm install --save @appbaseio/reactivesearch
```

### Step 2: Add ReactiveSearch's style file


If you haven't included any style framework, we recommend adding materialize.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/0.98.0/css/materialize.min.css">
```

All ReactiveSearch styles are present in a single file. We will import it in the &lt;head> element as well.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/appbaseio/reactivesearch/master/dist/css/style.min.css">
```

Make sure to import the stylessheets in the above order.
