**ReactiveBase** is a container component that wraps all the `ReactiveSearch` components together. It binds the backend app (data source) with the UI view components (elements wrapped within ReactiveBase), allowing a UI component to be reactively updated every time there is a change in the data source or in other UI components.

This is the first component you will need to add when using `ReactiveSearch`.

### Usage

```js
<ReactiveBase
  app="appname"
  credentials="abcdef123:abcdef12-ab12-ab12-ab12-abcdef123456"
>
    <Component1 .. />
    <Component2 .. />
</ReactiveBase>
```

### Props

- **app** `String`  
    app name as it appears on the dashboard. Refers to an index if you're using your own Elasticsearch cluster. (Multiple indexes can be connected to by specifiying comma separated index names)
- **type** `String` [optional]  
    types on which the queries should run on. Multiple types can be passed as comma separated values. The default behavior here is to search on all the app types.
- **credentials** `String` [optional]  
    app credentials as they appear on the dashboard. It should be a string of the format "username:password" and is used for authenticating the app. If you are not using an appbase.io app, credentials may not be necessary - although having an open-access Elasticsearch cluster is not recommended.
- **url** `String` [optional]  
    URL where Elasticsearch cluster is hosted, only needed if your app uses a non appbase.io URL.
- **headers** `Object` [optional]  
    set custom headers to be sent with each server request as key/value pairs. For example:

```js{4-6}
<ReactiveBase
  app="appname"
  credentials="abcdef123:abcdef12-ab12-ab12-ab12-abcdef123456"
  headers={{
      secret: 'reactivesearch-is-awesome'
  }}
>
    <Component1 .. />
    <Component2 .. />
</ReactiveBase>
```

- **analytics** `Boolean` [optional]     
    allows recording search analytics (and click analytics) when set to `true` and appbase.io is used as a backend. Defaults to `false`. Check the [analytics recipe](/advanced/analytics.html) for click analytics implementation.
- **theme** `Object` [optional]     
    allows over-writing of default styles by providing the respective key/values. You can read more about its usage [here](/theming/themes.html)
- **themePreset** `String` [optional]       
    allows over-writing of default styles by providing a preset value. Supported values are `light` (default) and `dark`. You can read more about its usage [here](/theming/themes.html)
- **transformRequest** `Function` [optional]  
    Enables transformation of network request before execution. This function will give you the the request object as the param and expect an updated request in return, for execution. Note that this is an experimental API and will likely change in the future.
- **graphQLUrl** `String` [optional]
    Allows user to query from GraphqQL server instead of `ElasticSearch` REST api. [graphql-compose-elasticsearch](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-elasticsearch) helps in transforming `GraphQL` queries into `ElasticSearch` rest api. Here is an example of `GraphQL` server which acts as proxy for `ElasticSearch`.

### Connect to Elasticsearch

> Note
>
> An **app** within ReactiveSearch's context refers to an **index** in Elasticsearch.

ReactiveSearch works out of the box with an Elasticsearch index hosted anywhere. You can use the `url` prop of the **ReactiveBase** component to connect the child ReactiveSearch components to your own index. For example,

```js
<ReactiveBase
  app="your-elasticsearch-index"
  url="http://your-elasticsearch-cluster"
>
    <Component1 .. />
    <Component2 .. />
</ReactiveBase>
```

It's also possible to secure your Elasticsearch cluster's access with a middleware proxy server that is connected to ReactiveSearch. This allows you to set up custom authorization rules, prevent misuse, only pass back non-sensitive data, etc. Here's an example app where we show this using a Node.JS / Express middleware:

- [Proxy Server](https://github.com/appbaseio-apps/reactivesearch-proxy-server)
- [Proxy Client](https://github.com/appbaseio-apps/reactivesearch-proxy-client)

> Note
>
> If you are using the **url** prop for an Elasticsearch cluster, ensure that your ReactiveSearch app can access the cluster. Typically, you will need to configure CORS in **elasticsearch.yml** to enable access.

```yaml
http.cors.enabled: true
http.cors.allow-credentials: true
http.cors.allow-origin: "http://reactive-search-app-domain.com:port"
http.cors.allow-headers: X-Requested-With, X-Auth-Token, Content-Type, Content-Length, Authorization, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, Accept
```

> Note
>
> If you are using Elasticsearch on AWS, then the recommended approach is to connect via the middleware proxy as they don't allow setting the Elasticsearch configurations.

### Next Steps

Once you have added the **ReactiveBase** component, you can get started with adding other components as its children.

* List specific components can be found  [here](/list-components/singlelist.html).
* Range specific components can be found  [here](/list-components/singlerange.html).
* Search specific components can be found [here](/search-components/datasearch.html).
* Result specific components can be found
[here](/result-components/resultlist.html).

You can read more about when to use which components in the overview guide [here](/getting-started/ComponentsIndex.html).
