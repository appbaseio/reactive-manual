We have built this library keeping you, the developer, in mind. If you're here, it is obvious that you want to create a custom component that is reactive in nature. Perhaps, you already have a component in your design kit and want it to work seamlessly with Reactivesearch.

With `ReactiveComponent`, you can convert any Vue Component into a Reactivesearch component i.e. your vue component will be able to talk to other Reactivesearch components and connect with your elasticsearch cluster seamlessly.

> How does this work?
>
> `ReactiveComponent` is a wrapper component that allows you to connect custom component(s) (passed as children) with the Vue ecosystem.

### Usage

For example, let's suppose that we are building an e-commerce store where we have a react component called `ColorPicker` which renders the `colors` passed to it as tiles, allowing us to filter the products by their colors.

![ColorPicker](https://i.imgur.com/wuKhCTT.png)

```javascript{2}
<color-picker
    :colors="['#000', '#666', '#fff']"
    @change="handleColorChange"
>
```

Now, let's assume that we have all these hex-codes stored as `keywords` in an Elasticsearch index. To display each unique color tile, we can run a `terms` aggregations query. The `defaultQuery` prop of ReactiveComponent allows us to do this and pass the results to a child component.

```javascript
<reactive-component
    componentId="myColorPicker"   // a unique id we will refer to later
    :defaultQuery=`() => ({
        aggs: {
            color: {
                terms: {
                    field: 'color'
                }
            }
        }
    })`
>
    <div slot-scope="{ aggregations, hits, setQuery }">
	    <color-picker-wrapper :aggregations="aggregations" :hits="hits" :setQuery="setQuery"/>
	</div>
</reactive-component>
```

The above snippet runs the `defaultQuery` passed to the ReactiveComponent when the component gets mounted and consequently pass the query results to the `ColorPickerWraper` component (i.e. child component of ReactiveComponent) as the following two props: `hits` and `aggregations`.

```javascript
<template>
    <div v-if="colors">
        <color-picker
            colors="colors"
            @change=`() => {
                // handles color change
                // we will define this in the next step
            }`
        />
    </div>
</template>
<script>
export default {
    props: {
        aggregations: Object,
    },
    computed: {
        colors: () => {
            let colors = [];
            if (
                // checking for when component gets the aggregation results
                this.$props.aggregations
                && this.$props.aggregations.colors
                && this.$props.aggregations.colors.buckets.length
            ) {
                colors = this.$props.aggregations.map(color => color.key);
            }
            return colors;
        },
    },
}
</script>
```

Up until this point, we have figured out how to display the colored tiles by running an Elasticsearch query and passing the results to our `ColorPickerWrapper` component.

But we also need to be able to filter the products by a color tile when selected by the end-user. This is where `setQuery()` prop comes in handy. It takes an object param of shape:

```javascript
{
    query: {},
    value: ''
}
```

where,

- **query** - is the query of the component,
- **value** - can be an array, string or number (This will be shown in selected filters and URLParams if active. In our case, this is the hex-code of the selected color tile)


In our current example, we would simply have to call `this.$props.setQuery()` with the updated query and value of the component:

```javascript
<template>
    <div v-if="colors">
        <color-picker
            colors="colors"
            @change="onChange"
        />
    </div>
</template>
<script>
export default {
    props: {
        aggregations: Object,
        setQuery: Function,
    },
    methods: {
        onChange(newColor) {   // handles color change
            const query = {
                query: {
                    term: { color: newColor }
                }
            };

            this.$props.setQuery({
                query,
                value: newColor
            })
        }
    },
    computed: {
        colors: () => {
            let colors = [];
            if (
                // checking for when component gets the aggregation results
                this.$props.aggregations
                && this.$props.aggregations.colors
                && this.$props.aggregations.colors.buckets.length
            ) {
                colors = this.$props.aggregations.map(color => color.key);
            }
            return colors;
        },
    },
}
</script>
```

### Props

#### Scope Data Object

- **hits** `Array`  
    `hits` prop is an array of results from the Elasticsearch query of the component.
- **aggregations** `Object`     
    `aggregations` prop contains the results from `aggs` Elasticsearch query of the component.
- **setQuery** `function`   
    `setQuery` function sets the query of the component. It takes an object param of shape:
```javascript
    {
        query: {}, // query of the component
        value: ''  // value of the component
    }
```
- **selectedValue** `any`   
`selectedValue` contains the current value of the component (which can be set via `setQuery()` function). This is used for URLParams and SelectedFilters.
- **isLoading** `Boolean`
    `true` means the query is in the execution state.
- **error** `any`
    contains the error details in case of any error.


#### ReactiveComponent
 
- **className** `String`  
    CSS class to be injected on the component container.
- **defaultQuery** `Function`  
    **returns** the default query to be applied to the component, as defined in Elasticsearch Query DSL.
- **react** `Object`
    `react` prop is available in components whose data view should reactively update when on or more dependent components change their states, e.g. [`ReactiveMap`](/map-components/reactivemap.html), [`ReactiveList`](/basic-components/reactivelist.html).
  - **key** `String`
      one of `and`, `or`, `not` defines the combining clause.
      - **and** clause implies that the results will be filtered by matches from **all** of the associated component states.
      - **or** clause implies that the results will be filtered by matches from **at least one** of the associated component states.
      - **not** clause implies that the results will be filtered by an **inverse** match of the associated component states.
  - **value** `String or Array or Object`
      - `String` is used for specifying a single component by its `componentId`.
      - `Array` is used for specifying multiple components by their `componentId`.
      - `Object` is used for nesting other key clauses.

- **URLParams** `Boolean` [optional]  
    enable creating a URL query string parameter based on the selected value of the list. This is useful for sharing URLs with the component state. Defaults to `false`.

## Events
- **queryChange** 
    is a event which accepts component's **prevQuery** and **nextQuery** as parameters. It is called everytime the component's query changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect whenever the component's query would change.
- **allData**  
    event which provides `hits` and `aggregations` as an object properties.
- **error**
    gets triggered in case of an error and provides the `error` object, which can be used for debugging or giving feedback to the user if needed.
