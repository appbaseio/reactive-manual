`DynamicRangeSlider` creates a numeric range slider UI component. It is used for granular filtering of numeric data.


Example uses:

* filtering products from a price range in an e-commerce shopping experience.
* filtering flights from a range of departure and arrival times.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```html
<template>
    <dynamic-range-slider  
      dataField="books_count"
      componentId="BookSensor"
      title="DynamicRangeSlider: Ratings"
    />
</template>
```

While `DynamicRangeSlider` only requires the above props to be used, it comes with many additional props for pre-setting default range values, setting the step value of the range slider, specifying labels for the range endpoints, etc.

### Usage With All Props

```html
<template>
    <dynamic-range-slider 
      dataField="books_count"
      componentId="BookSensor"
      title="DynamicRangeSlider: Ratings"
      :defaultSelected="function(min, max){
          return {
              start: min + 1000,
              end: max - 1000,
          }
      }"
      :rangeLabels="function(min, max){
          return {
              start: min + ' Books',
              end: max + ' Books',
          }
      }"
      :showFilter="true"
      :URLParams="false"
    />
</template>
```

## Props

- **componentId** `String`  
    unique identifier of the component, can be referenced in other components' `react` prop.
- **dataField** `String`  
    DB data field to be mapped with the component's UI view. The selected range creates a database query on this field.
- **nestedField** `String` [optional]  
    use to set the `nested`  mapping field that allows arrays of objects to be indexed in a way that they can be queried independently of each other. Applicable only when dataField is a part of `nested` type.
- **title** `String or JSX` [optional]  
    title of the component to be shown in the UI.
- **defaultSelected** `Function` [optional]  
    a function that accepts `min` and `max` range values as parameters and returns an object representing current selection from the range with `start` and `end` keys.
- **rangeLabels** `Function` [optional]  
    a function that accepts `min` and `max` range values as parameters and returns an object representing labels with `start` and `end` keys.
- **showFilter** `Boolean` [optional]  
    show the selected item as a filter in the selected filters view. Defaults to `true`.
- **URLParams** `Boolean` [optional]  
    enable creating a URL query string parameter based on the selected value of the list. This is useful for sharing URLs with the component state. Defaults to `false`.
  
## Styles

`DynamicRangeSlider` component supports `innerClass` prop with the following keys:

- `title`

## Extending

`DynamicRangeSlider` component can be extended to
1. customize the look and feel with `className`, `style`,
2. update the underlying DB query with `customQuery`,
3. connect with external interfaces using `beforeValueChange`, `valueChange` and `queryChange`.

```js
<dynamic-range-slider
  ...
  className="custom-class"
  :customQuery=`
    function(value, props) {
      return {
        query: {
            match: {
                data_field: "this is a test"
            }
        }
      }
    }
  `
  :beforeValueChange=`
    function(value) {
      // called before the value is set
      // returns a promise
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // update state or component props
        resolve()
        // or reject()
      })
    }`
  @valueChange=`
    function(value) {
      console.log("current value: ", value)
      // set the state
      // use the value with other js code
    }`
  @queryChange=`
    function(prevQuery, nextQuery) {
      // use the query with other js code
      console.log('prevQuery', prevQuery);
      console.log('nextQuery', nextQuery);
    }`
/>
```

- **className** `String`  
    CSS class to be injected on the component container.
- **customQuery** `Function`
    takes **value** and **props** as parameters and **returns** the data query to be applied to the component, as defined in Elasticsearch Query DSL.
    `Note:` customQuery is called on value changes in the **DynamicRangeSlider** component as long as the component is a part of `react` dependency of at least one other component.
- **beforeValueChange** `Function`  
    is a callback function which accepts component's future **value** as a parameter and **returns** a promise. It is called everytime before a component's value changes. The promise, if and when resolved, triggers the execution of the component's query and if rejected, kills the query execution. This method can act as a gatekeeper for query execution, since it only executes the query after the provided promise has been resolved.

## Events
- **queryChange**  
     is an event which accepts component's **prevQuery** and **nextQuery** as parameters. It is called everytime the component's query changes. This event is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect whenever the component's query would change.
    
- **valueChange**  
    is an event which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called everytime the component's value changes. This event is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect on value selection.For example: You want to show a pop-up modal with the valid discount coupon code when some range is selected in a “Discounted Price” DynamicRangeSlider.
