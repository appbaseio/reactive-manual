`RatingsFilter` creates a Ratings Filter UI component. It is used for filtering results based on a ratings score.


Example uses:
* filtering movie listings by their ratings.
* filtering items in an e-commerce search listing based on its ratings.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```js
<RatingsFilter
  componentId="ratingsSensor"
  dataField="ratings"
  data={[
    {"start": 4, "end": 5, "label": "4 & up"},
    {"start": 3, "end": 5, "label": "3 & up"},
    {"start": 1, "end": 5, "label": "All"}
  ]}
/>
```

### Usage With All Props

```js
<RatingsFilter
  componentId="CarCategorySensor"
  dataField="ratings"
  title="Ratings Filter"
  data={[
    {"start": 4, "end": 5, "label": "4 & up"},
    {"start": 3, "end": 5, "label": "3 & up"},
    {"start": 1, "end": 5, "label": "All"}
  ]}
  defaultValue={{
    "start": 4, "end": 5
  }}
  URLParams={false}
/>
```

## Props

- **componentId** `String`  
    unique identifier of the component, can be referenced in other components' `react` prop.
- **dataField** `String`  
    data field to be mapped with the component's UI view.
- **data** `Object Array`  
    collection of UI `label` with associated with `start` and `end` ratings values.
- **title** `String or JSX` [optional]  
    title of the component to be shown in the UI.
- **defaultValue** `Object` [optional]  
    selects a initial ratings value using `start` and `end` key values from one of the data elements.
- **value** `Object` [optional]  
    controls the current value of the component. It selects the item from the data (on mount and on update). Use this prop in conjunction with `onChange` function.
- **onChange** `function` [optional]  
    is a callback function which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called when you are using the `value` props and the component's value changes. This prop is used to implement the [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) behavior.
- **URLParams** `Boolean` [optional]  
    enable creating a URL query string parameter based on the selected rating. This is useful for sharing URLs with the component state. Defaults to `false`.

## Styles

`RatingsFilter` component supports `innerClass` prop with the following keys:    

- `title`
 
Read more about it [here](/theming/class.html).

## Extending

`RatingsFilter` component can be extended to
1. customize the look and feel with `className`, `style`,
2. update the underlying DB query with `customQuery`,
3. connect with external interfaces using `beforeValueChange`, `onValueChange` and `onQueryChange`.

```js
<RatingsFilter
  ...
  className="custom-class"
  style={{"paddingBottom": "10px"}}
  customQuery={
    function(value, props) {
      return {
        match: {
          data_field: "this is a test"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  beforeValueChange={
    function(value) {
      // called before the value is set
      // returns a promise
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // update state or component props
        resolve()
        // or reject()
      })
    }
  }
  onQueryChange={
    function(prevQuery, nextQuery) {
      // use the query with other js code
      console.log('prevQuery', prevQuery);
      console.log('nextQuery', nextQuery);
    }
  }
  onValueChange={
    function(value) {
      console.log("current value: ", value)
      // set the state
      // use the value with other js code
    }
  }
/>
```

- **className** `String`  
    CSS class to be injected on the component container.
- **style** `Object`  
    CSS styles to be applied to the **RatingsFilter** component.
- **customQuery** `Function`  
    takes **value** and **props** as parameters and **returns** the data query to be applied to the component, as defined in Elasticsearch Query DSL.
    `Note:` customQuery is called on value changes in the **RangeFilter** component as long as the component is a part of `react` dependency of at least one other component.
- **beforeValueChange** `Function`  
    is a callback function which accepts component's future **value** as a parameter and **returns** a promise. It is called everytime before a component's value changes. The promise, if and when resolved, triggers the execution of the component's query and if rejected, kills the query execution. This method can act as a gatekeeper for query execution, since it only executes the query after the provided promise has been resolved.
- **onValueChange** `Function`  
    is a callback function which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called everytime the component's value changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect on value selection. For example: You want to show a pop-up modal with the valid discount coupon code when a user searches for a product with a specific rating in a RatingsFilter.
- **onQueryChange** `Function`  
    is a callback function which accepts component's **prevQuery** and **nextQuery** as parameters. It is called everytime the component's query changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect whenever the component's query would change.
