### Installation

1. `cd reactive-manual` to go into the project root

## Contributing

### Create a branch

1. `git checkout master` from any folder in your local `reactive-manual` repository
1. `git pull origin master` to ensure you have the latest main code
1. `git checkout -b my-awesome-branch` (replacing `my-awesome-branch` with a suitable name) to create a branch

### Make the change

### Test the change

1. If possible, test any visual changes in all latest versions of common browsers, on both desktop and mobile.
1. Run `yarn check-all` from the project root. (This will run Prettier, ESLint, and Flow.)

### Push it

1. `git add -A && git commit -m "My awesome message"` (replacing `My awesome message` with a commit message, such as `Fixed a really awesome bug with UI`) to stage and commit your changes
